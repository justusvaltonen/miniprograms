Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. Redistributions of the Software must include attribution to the original sources of information used in creating the Software. A list of these sources, including their names, references, and URLs, must be provided in the Software documentation or accompanying materials. When modified by someone, their choise of ID is added to the sources. If one doesn't want to use their name or any other identifying data, they can use a default author nickname of 'Charlie', generate a fake name to use or use their own name.

3. If an author uses a made-up name, it has to be funny. Plain old 'Charlie' or 'Jenny' just won't do. Authors won't be penalised for not having a funny name if they try. Neither will be the distributers.

4. Use of ones own identity as logged author has the pourpose of being able to solve problems if the distributed code ends up being horrible. Also additional information can be added to the history ledger. Adding an e-mail is sensible. Adding ones favourite color is most likely not important. The ledger also has a pourpose of getting ones name mentioned all over the internet. This will generate internet-fame and that is good.

5. Structure and contents of this repository will change over time. When it happens, it happens. How exactly, is defined as unknown behaviour at the time of writing. While you may not change the contents of this license, you can append to it as much as you want. Exeption will be the modification rights to license version. There is no proper style picked for versioning iteration. It may be so that the next number will be negative or the system uses relative numbering. Example: First version is v1.7 and the second could be +1.2 based on how much development is done in between.

6. By distributing this repository, you may agree to, at some point in life, spend one evening in an event, that can be regarded as a 'hippy-drum-circle', if haven't done so already.
