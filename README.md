# miniprograms
Small pieces of code, scripts and programs. Trying to create my own license. I did create my License with the assist of ChatBot (ChatGPT v3.5). There is some humor involved and I don't know if it will be legally binding in a courtroom. Still I find that additions were neccessary or at least a good addition.

This whole repository assumes that you are running linux. There is no sense in adding some paths to windows machines if they are never used.


=============================================

-- Continue later --
1. Create the setup of enabling some of the bash scripts globally. Creating a simple UI for the setup wouldn't hurt. I just don't have the time ATM. Look in /etc/profile
2. Put some sourcecode that works to this repo. Doesn't have to be magnifico. IP (v4) filtering system seems to be useful. The code is somewhere...
3. Figure out how credentials are managed the best way.
4. Forgot about network stuff all together. Migrate at least something ASAP
