Not all in this folder is useful. Here are some small demonstrations on how the language works. Tested mostly on a linux machine with various versions of gcc.
To compile and run a program, the simplest form can be to write on your terminal:
gcc <yourfilename>.c
There should be a file called a.out as a result.
Run by typing <path-to-output-file>.out

Contains for example a converter with a small menu. Also there is a proof of an algorithm that does multiplying. Doesn't prove anything else, but that the answer is correct.
