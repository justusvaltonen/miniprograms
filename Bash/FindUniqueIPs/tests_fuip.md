# Tests to be done:
# 1. What if our ip has 2 digits only? What about 1? -- Handles well
# 2. Accepts things that start with or end with more than 3 digits. How to change?
# 3. Inside get_ipv4() there should be a toggler of -n that is only there for testing. Without the linenumbers behaviour is weird because of input data being only 2 digits on second octet.
# 4. Is this script pipeable? How to make it so? How do the pipes work?
# 5. How to disable things that start with 0?
# It may be a good idea to work in binary-level in these sorts of functions. Then again there is a lot to do with that also.
